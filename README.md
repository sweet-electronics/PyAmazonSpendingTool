# PyAmazonSpendingTool
Amazon Spending Tool for those of us who want to know how much we spent on previous Amazon purchases

## Requirements

You'll need to retrieve all your order history from Amazon.
That will give you a zip file that you will extract and use the "OrderHistory" csv file to get total amount spent
